# Implement Technology

## Use Python

I think I should use python -> golang technology to create the compiler.

Because Python is easy to use, and golang is good for cross-platform.

## Use regex expression

There has a lot of method to do the things, but regex expression is the most straightforward way.

## Use Golang
After the first python-based complier was made, I could then use it to make a golang compiler.

On the one-hand, is to test the hero programming language.

On the other-hand, is to make sure the hero compiler is cross-platformed.
