# hero
A general programming language.

## philosophy
* Simple as Python. (**no abbreviation**, **snake_case naming**, and support all python built-in functions and some core modules)
* Path name based script importing. No online package needed. (`import "./a_library.py" as a_library`)

* (Optional) Strict like Typescript but only for **string, number, bool, none, list, dict, class**, 7 basic types. (necessary type and code-block definition symbols: 'name:type' and 'function()->return_type' and '{code_block}') (This is only useful for translating code to typed_programming_language)
* (Optional) Small and executable like Golang. (cross-platform compile in a single machine. Either by doing code translation or modifying pre_compiled binary embedded hex source code) (Server code do not need cross-platform, if you do so, you already loss because you can't control your computing hardware)
