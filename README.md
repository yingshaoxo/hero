# hero
A general programming language.

## philosophy
* Simple as Python. (no abbreviation, snake_case naming, and support all python built-in library)
* Strict like Typescript. (necessary type and code-block definition symbols: ':' and '{}')
* Small and executable like Golang. (cross-platform compile in a single machine)
